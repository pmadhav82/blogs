# Host your nodejs application on AWS EC2 instance with Domain name
![blog-pic](https://images2.imgbox.com/34/8f/3UoFDTU2_o.png)

This blog post is about hosting your nodejs application on AWS `EC2` instance with domain name and secured it with the help of `certbot`. Let's get started.

1. Create `Ec2` instalce by choosing linux 2s

2. Leave everything default and click launch instance

3. Go to instances and click your instace and click on connect.
 Then, you will see option to connect to instance. If you want to access instance terminal from web-browser you can click on  `Connect` button of `EC2 Instance Connect`. Or, you can connect through SSH client. For that click on `SSH client` tab to see what steps to take.
 As per instructions provided here, you need to open `SSH client` such as linux terminal or git bash.
 Go to the folder where private key `.pem` file is located and run following command which will give read only permision to the file

 ``` 
 chmod 400 prevate-key-name.pem
 ```

 Then, you are ready to connect instance using its public DNS or public ip address by following command




```
ssh -i "node-server-key.pem" ec2-user@13.54.206.174
```

Here, private key name is `node-server-key`, user is `ec2-user` and public id address is `13.54.206.174`. You can use public DNS as well in place of public address
```
ssh -i "node-server-key.pem" ec2-user@ec2-13-54-206-174.ap-southeast-2.compute.amazonaws.com             
```

After that you can have access to terminal through SSH client. Once you have access to the terminal,type following command

``` 
sudo yum install -y gcc-c++ make
```

then, it install nodejs by typing following command
 Type following command

```
sudo yum install -y nodejs 
```

 To check the version of nodejs run
`node -v` command

4. Now you can clone node app from your github. Once the repo is downloaded go to that folder and run 
`npm instal`
 which will install all the dependency. For environmental variables, you can create a new directory and create a `.env` file there. You can put all environmental variables in that file:
```
 touch /var/app/env/.env
 ```
Edit the file by running `nano /var/app/env/.env`
 Save the `.env` file and we need `dotenv` package to load those environmental variables. For that run following command

 ```
 npm install dotenv
 ```
 Once it installed, in node.js application, we need config `dotenv` package on top of main application file.

 ```
require('dotenv').config({path: 'var/app/env/.env'})
 ```
For the access type your `publicIP:portNum`. In my case it is `http://13.54.206.174:3000/`


5. If you want to run your sever in the background you can you `pm2` which is a process manager for node.js application. `pm2` can handle to start, restart and stop the server and log managmement. To install `pm2` run following command
```
npm install pm2 -g
```
To start the server use command:

```
pm2 start app.js
```
![pm2-start](https://images2.imgbox.com/93/24/UKqw1gXs_o.png)

To verify your server is running run following command

```
pm2 list
```
This will display a list of all processes managed by `pm2`

To stop the server
```
pm2 stop app.js
```

6. If you have a domain name and you want to use it, you need to install `nginx` which is a web server by following command

```
sudo yum install nginx
```
To run nginx run the command `sudo systemctl start nginx` and visit `EC2` instance public IP address in the browser. You will see Nginx default welcome page.
Once it installed, you need to configure Nginx to act as a reverse proxy for the application. Open the configuration file by following command

```
sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
```

Then, edit the `nginx.conf` file as following:

```

  
http {
    listen 80;
    server_name pblog.online www.pblog.online;

    location / {
      proxy_pass http://localhost:8000;
proxy_http_version 1.1;
proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
proxy_set_header Host $host;
proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
}



```
Replace `pblog.online` with you `domain name`.
Once the file edited, we need to check if it is validate or not. For that run the following command:
```
sudo nginx -t

nginx: the configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf syntax is ok
nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful

```

If the test is successful, you can reload the nginx by the command `sudo nginx -s reload`.
You can check the nginx status by following command as well
```
sudo systemctl status nginx

‚óè nginx.service - The nginx HTTP and reverse proxy server
     Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/nginx.service; disabled; preset: disabled)
     Active: active (running) since Tue 2023-05-16 03:29:05 UTC; 43min ago


```

## Add Domain Name
To add a custom domain name, first  you need to assign Elastic IP address for you `EC2` instance. You can do that from EC2 Dashbord, there you will elastic ip under `Network & Security`. Once you have assigned elastic ip address go to your domain name provider account and find `DNS Records` section. There we need to add new record. So, click on `Add new record` option. Select record type `A`, in `Name` section type `www` and value will be your elastic IP address and save it.

Now, hit your domain URL in the browser. It will take some time but you can visit your application running on EC2 instance by entering your domain name.

But the connection is not secured. To make it secured we need to add `SSL` certificate. We can do it for free with the help of `Certbot`. Run following commands to install `certbot`:

```
sudo yum install python3 python3-venv libaugeas0
```

```
   sudo /opt/certbot/bin/pip install --upgrade pip
   ```

   ```
   sudo /opt/certbot/bin/pip install certbot certbot-nginx
   ```

   ```
   sudo ln -s /opt/certbot/bin/certbot /usr/bin/certbot
   ```

   ```
   sudo python3 -m venv /opt/certbot/
   ```

   Once it's done run the following command to get `ssl` certificate for you domain

   ```
   sudo certbot --nginx -d pblog.online -d www.pblog.online
   ```
Here, replace `pblog.online` with your own domain name.

`certbot` will ask you to confirm your domain name and add `ssl` certificate to your domain name. It will change configuration of `nginx.conf` file as well. Once the certificated is added `nginx.conf` file looks like this:
```
    server {
    server_name pblog.online www.pblog.online;

        root         /usr/share/nginx/html;

       # Load configuration files for the default server block.
        include /etc/nginx/default.d/*.conf;

        error_page 404 /404.html;
        location / {
 proxy_pass http://localhost:8000;
proxy_http_version 1.1;
proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
proxy_set_header Host $host;
proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
        }

        error_page 500 502 503 504 /50x.html;
        location = /50x.html {
        }
    
    listen [::]:443 ssl ipv6only=on; # managed by Certbot
    listen 443 ssl; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/pblog.online/fullchain.pem; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/pblog.online/privkey.pem; # managed by Certbot
    include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem; # managed by Certbot

}

    server {
    if ($host = www.pblog.online) {
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
    } # managed by Certbot


    if ($host = pblog.online) {
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
    } # managed by Certbot
 
        listen 80;
        listen [::]:80;
   
       server_name pblog.online www.pblog.online;
    return 404; # managed by Certbot

}


```
If you look at it closely, now our app is running on port 443 which is `https` connection. So, we have to make sure that port 443 is allowed in our `ec2` instance security groups. If your `ec2` instance security groups does not have `https` port enabled you can add new rule by clicking `add rule` button and select type `HTTPS`.

![security-groups](https://images2.imgbox.com/d2/e0/4FjSUpJB_o.png)

Now, visit your site by entering `https://www.YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME`.You will be able to see your site which is now secure with ssl certificate.

This way, you can run your `nodejs` app on `ec2` instance with custom domain name.
